# AI Assistance Log

This document tracks the use of AI tools in building this Django Stripe application.

## Tools Used

### Cursor AI (Primary Assistant)
- **Purpose**: Code generation, architecture decisions, and implementation
- **Usage**: 
  - Generated entire Django project structure
  - Created models, views, templates, and URL configurations
  - Implemented Stripe Checkout integration
  - Designed double-submit prevention mechanisms
  - Created Bootstrap-styled HTML template
  - Wrote management command for seeding products
  - Generated documentation (README.md)

### Areas Where AI Was Used

1. **Project Setup** (100% AI-generated)
   - Django project structure
   - Settings configuration with environment variables
   - URL routing setup

2. **Models** (100% AI-generated)
   - Product, Order, and OrderItem models
   - Field definitions and relationships
   - Admin interface configuration

3. **Views & Business Logic** (100% AI-generated)
   - Checkout session creation
   - Payment success/cancel handling
   - Webhook endpoint
   - Idempotency key implementation
   - Double-submit prevention logic

4. **Frontend** (100% AI-generated)
   - HTML template with Bootstrap styling
   - JavaScript for Stripe Checkout integration
   - Loading states and error handling
   - Responsive design

5. **Documentation** (100% AI-generated)
   - README.md with setup instructions
   - Code quality notes
   - Architecture decisions explanation

6. **Configuration Files** (100% AI-generated)
   - requirements.txt
   - .env.example
   - .gitignore

## Human Input

- **Requirements Analysis**: Understanding the assignment requirements
- **Architecture Decisions**: Choosing Stripe Checkout over Payment Intents
- **UX Decisions**: Single-page design choice
- **Review**: Code review and testing approach

## Notes

- All code was generated by AI but follows Django and Stripe best practices
- The implementation includes proper error handling, security measures, and user experience considerations
- The code is production-ready with minor modifications (environment variables, HTTPS, etc.)
